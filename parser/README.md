# Wrap Parser
This parser transforms a Wrap or Fountain file into a syntax tree which we can
use in the export modules.

> **WARNING**
> Ye who enter here. This parser was written at a time when the author was
> fairly inexperienced with Go. As such it isn't the most readable, maintainable
> nor elegant code. However it works and is fairly quick. A rewrite is something
> on the todo list for the very far future.
