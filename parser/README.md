This parser transforms a Wrap or Fountain file into a syntax tree which we can use in the export modules.

For more information see the [wiki](https://github.com/Wraparound/wrap/wiki) or if there is a bug you would like to report
or an idea to suggest you can do that [here](https://github.com/Wraparound/wrap/issues).
