A Fountain import and export tool with some extra's...

## Overview
Feltix is an open source command line tool that is able to convert Fountain and Feltix files into a correctly formatted
screen- or stageplay as an HTML or PDF.

Fountain is an awesome format to write screenplays in English, Feltix builds upon this to add support for different
languages and stageplays whilst still fully supporting normal Fountain files.

All this in a FOSS package that you can use straight from the commandline.
